Mythological background on Death:
The entity known as Azizoth, or Death, is an ancient spirit thought to have been created along with the mortal plane long ago. Many societies across the ages have had some form of belief in Azizoth, along with their own name and customs surrounding it. Furthermore, every culture has had a unique way of trying to contact the spirit and gain its favor. Most cultures have failed in this aspect, only managing to annoy or inconvenience it, resulting in cataclysmic retaliation. The best example of a botched summoning comes from the people of Easter Island, where the entire civilization mysteriously vanished. The ritual in this manual has been extensively researched and tested; showing great promise in gaining a boon from Death itself. Of all the boons possible from death, immortality may be the most attractive; beware, however, endless life may not be what you think.

Of Demise and Glory:
The adventure in question is neither for the faint of heart, nor for the unserious jesters and clowns. With immense power comes even greater risk, and failure will be met with unparalleled severity. It cannot be overstated, that the journey ahead is of such catastrophic consequence, that it must not be performed by anyone but the best and most determined, a fact to which the countless skeletons of novice wizards can attest. Proceed with caution, for the scars on body and soul shall be irreparable. The summoning of Death shall take a Herculean toll on the physical body, sapping its resources for the sustenance of the conjured. Likewise, the mental faculties shall be under siege by Death's alluring viles and charms. Should one fail to resist, the conjurer shall be transformed into a thrall, a mere vessel for Death's inhabitance. As for the soul, one foregoes any chance of Divine approval. The link which binds mortal souls to the plane of the Gods shall be severed, in failure as well as in victory. The soul shall fall into the dark abyss that is the underworld, surrounded by darkness and left to torment. Only should the endeavour succeed, shall the soul find nourishment and protection, in the hands of Death. Proceed at your own peril.
